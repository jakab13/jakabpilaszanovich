<h1 class="project-title">Maluma</h1>
<p>
    This was the first video I made in my life :) The title comes from a psychological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect" target="_blank">experiment</a> by Wolfgang Koehler who proved that people associate sounds to visual forms in a non-arbitrary fashion. Basically it means that we can associate round objects with words like ‘maluma’ and angular objects with words like 'takite’. The psychology of synaesthesia-like behaviour always fascinated me and this was an opportunity to create something about it. In this video I wanted to show the relationship between the sounds I made and the shapes appearing on screen.

    There’s another aspect to the video. The first part shows the life of malumas. They are white, curvy, round, two dimensional, they vary in size, they move around and feel totally comfortable in their on world. At one point the takites appear, who are shiny, spikey, three dimensional, angular and motionless. As the takites approach, the malumas start to shake and can’t handle the situation of seeing something completely new to their world. For them, the takites are not only objects that they haven’t thought of before, but more importantly, they were not <bold>able</bold> to think about anything like this before. Therefore the extatic, chaotic reaction. Finally the malumas vanish and the takites become the main characters.

    This short story wants to point out a phenomena that I find very typical to our behaviour. We tend to feel comfortable in our own worlds. Once a new ideology - which has totally different dimensions than our own - is introduced, we don’t know how to handle it. Or looking at it from a different angle, the only way that an ideology can radically influence an already existing one is if it doesn’t only state the anti-thesis of the original thesis. It has to introduce a completely new form of thinking.
