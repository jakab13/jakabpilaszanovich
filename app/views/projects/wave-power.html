    This report outlines the evolution of wave energy generation and the central role that the University of Edinburgh has played in research and development into this emerging industry. It explains the theory behind the devices that are currently being developed and the economical and technical capabilities these technologies have. The pros and cons of this renewable energy source are also discussed and comparisons to already established industries are made. This project introduced me to the physics, technology and politics of energy production and the significance of renewable energies.

    The research was carried out at the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with 5 other students. It involved collective brainstorming sessions, individual research on the subject area and the collaborative write up of the report. My primary task on the theoretical part of the project was to do a research on the various designs and technologies of Wave Energy Converters and to present these on a level of physics knowledge that is accessible to peer students. Our main goal was to make the report and the presentation easy to understand and interesting while maintaining a high level of scientific knowledge.
