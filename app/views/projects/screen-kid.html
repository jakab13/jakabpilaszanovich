    This was my 4 piece band for almost 4 years. I played drums, laptop beats/noises and some synth. We all came from very different musical backgrounds so it was interesting to see how we can work in a small group together while keeping our individual inputs strong. We were always fascinated about how we can mix synthetic electronic sounds with the organic acoustic sound of our instruments and voices. This is a recurring theme in my other projects as well.
