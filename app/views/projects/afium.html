<h1 class="project-title">Afium</h1>
<p>
    Afium is an algorithmic composition and signal processing project written in the Common Lisp Music (CLM) programming environment. One of the aims of the project was to create a musical piece which is rich in variations of timbral content. The transformations from one musical phrase to another are always linked such that one attribute/characteristic of the given sound is developed throughout the phrase which characteristic is then found in the beginning of the next section. These “guides” of transformations can be frequency, movement of frequency, grain content, rhythm and the mixture of these.

    The non-real time nature of CLM suggests that musical forms and the role of time development is independent from computational processing. This lead to the elaboration of using time as a variable in functions. This resulted in unusual musical motifs which could not be reproduced with a DAW program.

    The process of writing and composing Afium could be divided into two parts. The first part contained the writing of codes which achieved certain sound structures on the microlevel. These were typically five seconds long with a rich texture, and their role was just to serve as samples which can then be used later on. The second part of the process was the composition on the macrolevel. This is the level of timescale where the transformations were defined and specified. The use of stochastic processes was used in a wider range for the substructures of the microlevel, however were only included as shaping curvatures of the musical transformations on the macrolevel. The idea of this limited randomness to create a varying but coherent scene comes back in my other projects as well.
