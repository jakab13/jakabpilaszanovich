<h1 class="project-title">Morphing</h1>
<p>
   Morphing is an implementation written in Max/MSP which utilises motion detection and MIDI data as its main controllers. These interfaces are used for DSP of pre-recorded samples. The samples are divided into two main groups: wood and metal, which sounds were captured with a piezo-electric transducer. The program allows a performance in which one sound family can be morphed to the other via movement of one performer while the other performer is able to control DSP effects such as granular synthesis, playback speed of samples, time stretching and chorus effect with MIDI.

    It creates an interactive environment where the performer is mutually influential with the instrument: the instrument (sound) reacts to the motion of the performer while the performer is influenced by the sound of the instrument. Morphing gives an improvisative nature to the performance which is a crucial part and result of interactive music in an indeterministic environment. The indeterminacy of the project comes from the fact that non-traditional musical characteristics were assigned to movement, as well as the uniqueness of the performer’s movements.

    Max/MSP’s graphical environment allows the programmer to create a visual patch which is easy to understand and control. Top-down programming techniques were used where the parameters to be controlled were initially realised and the patching was designed according to the needs of control. Another important aim was to have a direct response in music to the movement of the performer in order to let them engage in the sonic environment in a short period of time. Higher level events (time-stretching, granular synthesis) are not directly related to the movements, however they are linked.
